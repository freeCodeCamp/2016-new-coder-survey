# The 2016 New Coder Survey

We announced on [March 29th,
2016](https://twitter.com/FreeCodeCamp/status/714930182721679360) that we'd like  to better understand new coders using a survey.

Survey development was lead by [Quincy Larson](https://twitter.com/ossia) with Free Code Camp and [Saron Yitbarek](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek) with Code Newbie. For more about why we made this survey: ["How we crafted a survey for thousands of people who are learning to code"](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-just-launched-the-biggest-ever-survey-of-people-learning-to-code-cac81dadf1ea#.8g9ts8gm5).
