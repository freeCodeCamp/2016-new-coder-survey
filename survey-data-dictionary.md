# Survey Data Dictionary

This file contains a list of the questions from the survey and descriptions on
what each question can have as an answer.

The variable section for each question (**Variable**) is the column name in the
cleaned up dataset.


## Data and Survey Description

The survey itself is separated into two parts: (1) information about coding and
(2) demographic information.

This is not the same as the two parts of the raw data. The first dataset
contains all responses for the first half of the survey. The second dataset
contains all responses for the first and second parts of the survey of those who
submitted both parts of the survey.

There are multiple types of questions:

- free text where user inputs values
- multiple choice in choosing one answer
- multiple choice allowing for multiple selections


## Missing Data Encoding

There is missing data in the dataset for several reasons, which will be encoded
as follows in the parentheses:

- Conditioning (`-11`) - This is for values that cannot be answered because
  they do pass the condition for this question. E.g. you can't answer a question
  about how long ago you finished a bootcamp if you answered `no` to finishing
  one.
- Not Selected (`-55`) - This is for values in questions where you can select
  multiple answers e.g. learning resources you find helpful. Some choices won't
  be selected and will be coded as so.
- Not Available (`-99`) - This is for when the surveyed skipped the question all
  together.


## Example Question Description

> ### Question 1
> 
> - **Question Type**: Single Answer
> - **Variable**: `quest1`
> - **Type**: Boolean
> - **Options**: Yes (1), No (0)
> - **Note**: This should have a value.
